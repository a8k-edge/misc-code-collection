Automated URL Checking:

Implement a scheduler (like python-crontab) for daily checks of URL content changes.
Notification System:

Develop a system to notify you of changes, possibly through email or other messaging services.
Enhanced Testing and Debugging:

Develop more comprehensive tests, including integration tests.
Set up logging and debugging tools.

API Rate Limiting and Security:
Implement rate limiting to protect the API from abuse.

Containerization:

Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment environments.
Deployment:

Deploy the application to a cloud provider or a server.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
